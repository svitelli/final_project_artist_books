## About the Collection

This site is generated using [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/), a project to create a free and simple digital collection using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from: 

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPG images

## Background

This project is a digital library featuring the IU Science Library’s collection of artist books. The collection was acquired by the library recently and is made up of 21 different books created by artists depicting a particular subject related to science in a creative, artistic way. It includes a scan of the cover of each book, along with an interior page for a select few items to showcase the content. Due to copyright limitations, I could not include a full scan of any of the books. The significance of this project is it will showcase a new, unique collection in the Sciences Library. 
This project will complement an exhibit created by the Smithsonian Institution Libraries and the Washington Project for the Arts called Science and the Artist’s Books [(https://www.sil.si.edu/exhibitions/science-and-the-artists-book/contents.htm)]((https://www.sil.si.edu/exhibitions/science-and-the-artists-book/contents.htm)). This exhibit features artist books that were created based on Bern Dibner’s Heralds of Science, a publication that listed 200 works that Dibner considered to be “pivotal in the history of science.” Each artist based their book on one of these “Heralds.” Art and science are very intertwined, and this project, in conjunction with the Smithsonian collection, will highlight examples of books as art objects themselves and the innovative ways topics in science can be captured and shared.  
​​I am personally interested in this project because of my work in the Sciences Library, and my interest and background in science (I studied psychology and neuroscience at my undergraduate institution). I am hoping to use this project to learn more about these particular artist books and artist books in general and their use in science and the art field. I hope that as I describe these books for my project, it will help the Sciences Library in the creation of a LibGuide that also showcases these books for the IU community and beyond.

## Contributors

My name is Sarah Vitelli, and I am a second-year student in the MLS program at Indiana University. I would like to thank the librarians at the Sciences Library for their help with the Artist Books, specifically Jen Simms and Bob Noel. I would also like to thank Professor John Walsh and Alex Wingate for their instruction and assistance this semester. 

## About the Metadata

[Here]((https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UodEMe0gBA8Uf0RT7PhEUqp4GUYyFw2_pIrZPypBSR8/edit)) is a link to the metadata application profile (MAP) I created to build this digital library. I used two controlled vocabularies for the “subject” metadata field, the [Proposed International Standard Nomenclature for Fields of Science and Technology (SKOS)](https://skos.um.es/unesco6/#:~:text=The%20Proposed%20international%20standard%20nomenclature,by%20the%20Scientific%20Advisory%20Committee.) for science subjects, and [Getty’s Art & Architecture Thesaurus (AAT)](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/) for art subjects.

## Technology Information

I used an overhead scanner located in Wells Library at Indiana University to digitize these materials. This was beneficial since some of the materials could potentially be damaged by using a typical flatbed scanner.
